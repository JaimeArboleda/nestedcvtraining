# Examples

There are several examples showing the different aspects of the library:

* [Example 1](https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining/blob/master/examples/api_examples.ipynb): In this example we show how to define a model using the `SwitchCase`, how to define the `search_space` and how to interpret the results obtained in a simple manner. 
* [Example 2](https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining/blob/master/examples/custom_reports.ipynb): In this example we show how to create custom reports of the nested cross validation results. 
* [Example 3](https://github.com/JaimeArboleda/nestedcvtraining/blob/master/examples/undersampling.ipynb): In this example we show how to use the `UnderSamplingClassifier`.
